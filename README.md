## 1. Project Title
E-Sports Tournament Tracker

## 2. Project Description
The E-Sports Tournament Tracker is a simple blockchain-based application built with Clarity smart contracts. It allows users to add tournament details and record the winner of a tournament in a transparent and tamper-proof way.

This ensures that tournament records are stored on-chain, enabling trustless verification of results for players, teams, and organizers.

## 3. Project Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized, secure, and transparent platform for managing e-sports tournaments globally. This platform aims to eliminate disputes regarding tournament outcomes and prize distributions by keeping all records on the blockchain.

## 4. Future Scope
- Adding prize distribution mechanisms directly from the contract.
- Allowing users to register as participants.
- Integrating NFT trophies for winners.
- Building a front-end dashboard for live tracking.
- Implementing tournament brackets and match histories.
